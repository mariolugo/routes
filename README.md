## Getting Started

First, install libraries (I was using Node 12.18.0):

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To run the tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

To run the test coverage

```bash
yarn test:coverage
```

## Workflow

The branching model used is gitflow, this helps a lot with collaboration and scaling the development team.

### master

deployments to production

### develop

Developtment branch.

### feature/initial_setup

Creating the initial setup, installing libraries, adding a precommiter, eslint and prettier

### feature/layout

Creating the base layout with `react-bootstrap` and adding google maps component.

## Styling

Used `eslint`,it is going to tell you if youâ€™ve imported something and not used it, if your function could be short-handed, and loads of other little gotchas that you can fully configure.

Used `prettier`, it is an opinionated code formatter, this will assure that the code styling is the same.

## Libraries Used

These are ones of the major libraries I used to accomplish this test.

### Next.js

Use to use SSR (server side rendering features), this can improve the SEO.

### React-bootstrap

I used React-bootstrap to use components instead of classes (Bulma).

### husky

precommit, ensure same slyting and no javascript errors before commit

### eslint

linter tool to find and fix problems in javascript code.

### prettier

to share the same code styling

### PropTypes

Used for component documentaiton
